# **Shell script Control flow**

>**this mini project is about shell scripting control flow statement like if-else, for loops, while loops, and case statement to control the flow of execution in your scripts .**

----
> **Control Flow statement**
_these are_
- if-else
- for loops
- while loops
- case statements

> **if-else Statement**

>**Control Flow**<br>
_script named `control_flow.sh` to write and execute script_

![](./Img/2.0%20control%20vs.jpg)
_using `bash` to execute the script and output the program_

_updating the script_

>**If statement**<br>
_`if statement` in bash allow us to execute a statement_
![](./Img/if.statement.jpg)
_Update the script, then execute it with `./if_statement.sh` command_

>**elif statement**<br>
_after understanding the if statement, i move to `elif` which means `else if`. it aloow you to test additional condition previous if condition were not met_<br>
script created `elif_statement`

># **Loop Statement**<br>
_loop allows you to execute a set of instruction over time without repeating set of code_

>**for_loop**<br>
_the for loop is use to iterate over a list of values or range of numbers_<br>
script created `for_loop`
![](./Img/7%20for%20loop.jpg)
![](./Img/7.%20for%20loop.jpg)
excute with `./for_loop` command
![](./Img/7.1%20output.jpg)


>**while_loop**<br>
_An until loop in Bash is used when you want to execute a block of code until a specific condition becomes true_<br>
script created `until_loop`
![](./Img/while%20loop%20fol.jpg)
![](./Img/8%20whilw%20loop%20editor.jpg)
excute with `./while_loop` command
![](./Img/8.%20output%20whie.jpg)

>**until_loop**<br>
_This is the condition for the while loop. The loop will continue running as long as counter is less than or equal to_<br>
script created `until_loop`
![](./Img/untill%20created.jpg)
![](./Img/9.%20untill%20loop.jpg)
excute with `./until_loop` command
![](./Img/9.0%20output%20until.jpg)


># **C-style form**<br>
_C- style is powerful in numerical condition and statement_

>**c-style_form**<br>
script created `c_style_form`
![](./Img/c%20form.jpg)
![](./Img/10.%20c%20style.jpg)
excute with `./for_loop` command
